This repository contains the code for each of the three experiments detailed in our project
 
  Fall Program Directed Studies 2021: BamfieldDSProject2021.Rmd describes our _Littorina spp._ snails abundance experiment
  
  UBC Directed Studies 2022: DSBarnacleDislodgementStats2022.Rmd describes our dead _Balanus glandula_ adhesion strength through time experiment
  
  UBC Idependent Research Project: SimulatedWaveDislodgementIRP.Rmd describes the protectional role of _Balanus glandula_ in mitigating wave like forces                                      for _Littorina spp._ snails
